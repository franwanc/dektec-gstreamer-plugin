Introduction
============

This file describes the Dektec DTA-2152 card GStreamer SDI source plugin
demonstration instructions. This GStreamer SDI source element reads raw
SDI data from DTA-2152 SDI input ports (thorough Dektec DTAPI), and feeds
raw video frame-by-frame to its video source pad, so that to be connected
to other GStreamer transform/filter/sink elements.

setup
=====

The plugin has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 Linux platform. The procedure 
to setup the environment as follows.

to setup pc:
- test PC w/ intel Xeon CPU + 4GB Ram (or equivalent)
- PCIe slot hosting DTA-2152 Card
- install Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit desktop version
  - img downloadable from http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04.5/

to setup DTA-2152:  
- download the LinuxSDK Oct 2014 version from dektec website
- unzip LinuxSDK to a folder and,
- goto LinuxSDK\Drivers\Dta\Source\Linux, run 'make' then 'sudo make install'
  to install the Dektec linux driver
- check the installed DTA device w/ 'lsmod' command
- download DtRecord and DtPlay utilities from Dektec website
- compile and test run DtRecord and DtPlay for SDI card sanity check

to setup GStreamer 1.0:
- run following commands to install GStreamer 1.0 components needed after
  a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 install:
  - sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
  - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gstreamer-developers/ppa
  - sudo apt-get update
  - sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0*
- once above all done, run following command to sanity check the GST:
  - gst-launch-1.0 videotestsrc ! xvimagesink
    - you should be able to see the video test pattern running in one of
      your Linux PC desktop window

to compile the dektec plugin:
- get 'dt-plugin' tar ball and unzip it to a folder
- cd 'dt-plugin'
- run './autogen.sh', 'make clean' then 'make' 
- above will compile the 'dt-plugin' libtool project and generate the 
  shared object 'libgstdektec.so' under 'dt-plugin/src/.libs/' as the actual
  GStreamer plugin that we intend to create
- note, this libtool project includes the Dektec DTAPI header and binary
  to compile/link with under 'dt-plugin/DTAPI' folder  

to inspect dektec plugin:
- create '/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0' as system gst lib folder
- run 'export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0' in current shell
- copy the GST plugin (.so file that you just generated) to GST lib folder
  by cmd 'sudo cp src/.libs/libgstdektec.so /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0/'
- run 'gst-inspect-1.0 dta2152src' to inspect the new plugin
  - it should show list of info including element pads/params
  - SDI format & port number (1/2) will be plugin parameters as following:
  mode                : Video mode to use for capture
                        flags: readable, writable
                        Enum "GstDta2152Modes" Default: 0, "NTSC SD 60i"
                           (0): NTSC SD 60i      - ntsc
                           (1): PAL SD 50i       - pal
                           (2): HD1080 59.94i    - 1080i5994
                           (3): HD1080 50i       - 1080i50
                           (4): HD720 59.94p     - 720p5994
                           (5): HD720 50p        - 720p50
  connection          : Video input connection to use
                        flags: readable, writable
                        Enum "GstDta2152Connection" Default: 0, "SDI"
                           (0): SDI              - sdi
  port-number         : Capture port instance to use
                        flags: readable, writable
                        Integer. Range: 1 - 2 Default: 1 

to run dta-2152 SDI input viewing demo:
- provide a SDI input feed to one of the DTA-2152 two SDI ports
- launch gst pipeline with following cmd (PAL input from port 1 for example)
  'gst-launch-1.0 -v dta2152src mode=1 port-number=1 ! xvimagesink sync=false'
- you should be able to view the input SDI full-frame video running in a 
  desktop window (full-frame includes VANC and HANC regions and also for 
  interlaced format, it will show both fields separately one on the top 
  half and the other on the bottom half - this was just for demonstration 
  purposes)
- 'ctrl-c' to terminate 
- by changing input and corresponding 'mode' parameter, element will work 
  with format from one of PAL/NTSC/1080i29.97/1080i25/720p59.94/720p50 
- by changing inputs and correponding 'port-number' parameter, element will
  read data from either one of the two SDI ports
  
to run dta-2152 SDI data w/ x264 realtime encoding (save to ts file):
- provide SDI input feed
- launch gst pipeline with cmd (720p59.94 inputting to port 1 for example)
  - gst-launch-1.0 -v dta2152src mode=4 connection=0 port-number=1 ! \
    videoconvert ! queue leaky=1 ! x264enc ! mpegtsmux ! filesink location=720p59.ts    
- 'ctrl-c' to terminate      
- after running for a period and then terminating, you should be able to
  find a '720p59.ts' file as encoded output
- vlc or other viewers should be able to play this ts video file 
- encoding also tested with other SDI formats listed above
